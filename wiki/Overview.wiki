==A tool for converting C programs into Monotonicity Constraints systems==
Welcome to MCfromC Wiki. This project is dedicated for the development of a tool which is able to convert programs written using a subset of the C language into a set of Monotonicity Constraints (MC) graphs.

== High Level Design Overview ==
The project consists of 4 different parts (separated into 3 DLL's and one executable):
 # *SyntaxParserDLL.dll* 
   * This module is mostly an auto generated LALR parser for the subset of the C language we are handling. 
   * The parser is generated using Flex and Bison tools. 
   * The parser's input is a C program file, and it's output is an Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) of the program (given that the program was of correct syntax). 
   * This module is written in C.
 # *CFGGen.dll*
   * This module concentrates all the main algorithm of the projects, and it is written in C++.
   * It includes mainly the following algorithms:
      * Syntax2CFG - Conversion of the AST into a Control Flow Graph(CFG).
      * CFGExprEvaluator - Algorithm for evaluating expressions and expression blocks.
      * Algorithm for generation of MC graphs on the edges of the CFG.
 # *ParserDotNetBridge.dll*
      * An interop mananged C++ module for bridging the gap between the CFGGen C++ module and .NET applications using the algoritms.
 # *CFGViewer.exe*
      * An application which enables viewing the C programs and the generated CFGs and MC graphs, side-by-side.
